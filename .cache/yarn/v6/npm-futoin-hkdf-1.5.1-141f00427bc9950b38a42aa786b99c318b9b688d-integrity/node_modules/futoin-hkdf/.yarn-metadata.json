Key Schedule](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-7.1).\n\nThe implementation is fully compliant with test vectors provided in the RFC.\n\nThere are alternative modules, but they are:\n* much less performing and/or\n* have quite poor code quality at the moment and/or\n* are not compliant with RFC (e.g. work only with string parameters) and/or\n* not working with current Node.js versions and/or\n* do not support arbitrary hash functions and/or\n* not reliable dependency for FutoIn™ Security concept in general.\n\nStandalone HKDF `extract()` and `expand()` actions are also available for advanced usage.\n\n**Documentation** --> [FutoIn™ Guide](https://futoin.org/docs/miscjs/hkdf/)\n\nAuthor: [Andrey Galkin](mailto:andrey@futoin.org)\n\n# Performance comparison\n\nThe figures in \"derived keys per second\".\n\n* **futoin-hkdf** -
